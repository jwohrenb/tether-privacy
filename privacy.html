    Tether (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, or ‚Äúus‚Äù) is a Chrome Extension designed to help users schedule meetings by detecting scheduling intent in Gmail and suggesting optimal meeting times based on your Google Calendar availability.

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Calendar availability (read-only):</strong> We request access to your free/busy information to identify time slots that are available in your calendar.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> access, collect, store, or transmit any personal calendar event details, titles, attendees, or descriptions.
  </p>

  <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify and suggest overlapping meeting times with others in your organization.</li>
    <li>Auto-fill the body of email drafts with suggested meeting slots.</li>
  </ul>
